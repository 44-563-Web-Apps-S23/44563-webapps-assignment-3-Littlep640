    <h3>Basketball</h3>
    <p>I like the sport of basketball because it takes a lot of <b> practice </b> to get really good at.
        The <b> devotion </b> people have to the sport is amazing. 
        If you are taller you'd typically have a better time playing.

<h3>Table of Countries to Visit</h3>

    All of the countries should be some fun.
    There will be a good variety of countries from different continents.
