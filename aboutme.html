            Some interesting facts about myself is that my favorite color is orange. 
            I am red-green colorblind. 
            I used to be in a hackeysack club back in highschool and we were 'sponsored' by McDonalds. 
            I have had the same group of friends since middle school.

        <h1>My favorite book is Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief</h1>
        <p>
            The book is my favorite because it is very interesting.
            I have always been a sucker for a geek/loser to hero story.
            The book brings in old gods which is cool.
            The book is fairly easy to read and will suck you in.
